# AArch64 python compiler
 A Compiler for AArch64 Apple Silicon for a Subset of Python.

Everything is pure python and depends on the standard library.

For compilation on your machine, you need Xcode installed. Open up a shell and type xcode-select --install and you're good to go.

Usage

python3 compiler.py python_test.txt 

The executable will be named "output" by default.

You can specify an executable name as the third argument

python3 compiler.py python_test.txt executable_file

Currently implemented commands 
 - Single Line Comments
 - """ Multiline Comments """
 - Variable Declaration var = "Foo" or 2
 - User Input var = input("What the Foo?")
 - print("String") + print(1+2)

Immediate Goals
 - Mathematical operations beyond just addition (-, *, /)
 - Boolean expressions and conditional statements (if/else)
 - Loops (while and for)
 - Functions
 - Arrays or lists

End Goals
 - Turing Completion
 - Inline Assembly
 - Ability to utilize LibC
 - Probably Force Static typing and declaration of allocated space needed for variables to avoid buffer overflows

This is a toy project as a proof of concept that Python can compile Python and not production ready in the slightest. This is mostly for smart allecks in Beginner Programming Groups that denigrate people who ask if Python can compile to an executable.
